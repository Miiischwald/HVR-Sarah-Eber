# HVR-Sarah-Eber

This project contains a minimal Next.js setup in TypeScript styled with Tailwind CSS. The homepage recreates the layout and content of the original Hausverwaltung Sarah Ebner start page.

To build the project locally you will need Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Due to environment restrictions dependencies might need to be installed manually.
